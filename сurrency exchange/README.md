# Currency exchange

There are several currencies: X_1, X_2, ...., X_n. We know for any currency pair its exchange rate: E[X_i, X_j] = Y_ij.
1. Write a program that prints:
- a сurrency conversion chain X_1 -> X_i1 -> X_i2 -> ... -> X_im -> X_1 which leads to profit if such a chain exists
- "NO" if there is no chain that leads to profit
2. The same as 1. but you have to find minimal chain
